# Voice-Indistinguishability: Protecting Voiceprint with Differential Privacy


With the rising adoption of advanced voice-based technology together with increasing consumer demand for smart devices, voice-controlled “virtual assistants” such as Apple’s Siri and Google Assistant have been integrated into people’s daily lives.
However, privacy and security concerns may hinder the development of such voice-based applications since speech data contain the speaker's biometric identifier, i.e., voiceprint (as analogous to ﬁngerprint).
To alleviate privacy concerns in speech data collection, we propose a fast speech data de-identification system that allows a user to share her speech data with formal privacy guarantee to an untrusted server.
Our open-sourced system can be easily integrated into other speech processing systems for collecting users' voice data in a privacy-preserving way.
Experiments on public datasets verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed system.

## Implementation
The code "tts1_ccs" was used in the experiments of the above paper.
This is implemented based on espnet. <br>
